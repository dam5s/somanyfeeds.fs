Meanwhile &#8220;part two&#8221; of the mobile version is already out now for <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/new-pac-man-rayman-and-shantae-games-are-headed-to-apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve got big Shantae news! Shantae and the Seven Sirens is planned for release on May 28 on Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC in its entirety, and the &quot;part 2&quot; update is out now on Apple Arcade! Take a look at the new trailer and get more info at <a href="https://t.co/dDNFVtctCb">https://t.co/dDNFVtctCb</a>! <a href="https://t.co/rBIm5eI3cD">pic.twitter.com/rBIm5eI3cD</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Along with the reveal is a brand new trailer showcasing both the story and gameplay of the fifth main entry in the franchise. As always, the visuals are colorful and fun, sporting that old school anime charm that&#8217;s become the trademark of the series. Gameplay is just as charming and it&#8217;s interesting to see some of her new abilities at work.</p>

<p>In addition to the digital version of the game, a physical version &#8212; including both a standard edition and a collector’s edition for some platforms &#8212; is planned from Limited Run Games. An official release date and other details will be revealed at a later date.</p>
<p>WayForward previously revealed <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/kill-la-kill-studio-trigger-opening-shantae-5/">the animated opening</a> for <em>Shantae and the Seven Sirens</em> that was animated by Studio Trigger, a Japanese animation studio best known for their work on <em>Little Witch Academia</em> and <em>Kill la Kill. </em>This compliments one of the title&#8217;s biggest new features, which is 4K hand-painted visuals on consoles that support the resolution and boasts &#8220;TV-style cutscenes.&#8221; Originally it was known as <em>Shantae 5</em> but finally received its full name <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/shantae-and-the-seven-sirens-announcement/">back in August</a>.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://wayforward.com/wayforward-announces-new-details-and-release-date-for-shantae-and-the-seven-sirens/">official site&#8217;s synopsis</a>: &#8220;Shantae visits a tropical paradise where she befriends new Half-Genie allies, but things quickly go awry as she discovers that sinister secrets are stirring beneath the island’s surface. As Shantae gets wrapped up in the island’s mysteries, she’ll use all-new dance abilities and instant-transformation Fusion Magic to explore the nonlinear, interconnected world and battle an assortment of diabolical foes… not the least of which are the enigmatic Seven Sirens.&#8221;</p>

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.dualshockers.com/horizon-zero-dawn-coming-to-titan-comics-in-july/"><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Titan-Comics-Horizon-Zero-Dawn-1024x576.png" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" srcset="https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Titan-Comics-Horizon-Zero-Dawn-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Titan-Comics-Horizon-Zero-Dawn-670x377.png 670w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Titan-Comics-Horizon-Zero-Dawn-768x432.png 768w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Titan-Comics-Horizon-Zero-Dawn.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p>The adventures of Aloy are set to return, long before we finally get our hands on <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sequel-guerrilla-hiring-spree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a sequel</a> to Guerilla Games&#8217; hit title, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. A new comic book series, written by Anne Toole, is set to explore the story after the events of the first game. Anne is known for having been a writer on <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, as well as written work that can be found in games such as <em>Days Gone</em>, <em>The Witcher</em> and TV shows such as &#8220;Days of Our Lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The setting of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, set within a 31st-century future where humans have shunned technology and turned to tribe-like existences, resonated well with audiences around the world. Sales figures, as reported in February of 2019 by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/02/28/horizon-zero-dawn-over-10-million-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VG247</a>, show that <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em>comfortably passed 10 million sales worldwide. There&#8217;s definitely an audience there for more stories within that same universe, and Sony hasn&#8217;t stopped trying to appeal to new demographics through the use of <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/horizon-zero-dawn-board-game-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different mediums</a>. They&#8217;re even bringing the once PS4 exclusive title to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC</a> in the next few months.</p>
<p>The comic will be illustrated by Indonesian artist <a href="https://www.artstation.com/n-maulina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ann Maulina</a>, and will be based around Talanah, a hunter searching for a purpose after the disappearance of Aloy. Whilst traveling the wilds, she comes across a new breed of killer machines as she&#8217;s investigating a mysterious new threat. What that&#8217;ll mean for her and the tribes we&#8217;ll have to wait and see. &#8216;Fans are going to absolutely love the stories we have to tell of Talanah and Aloy as we expand the Horizon Zero Dawn universe in this new comic series,&#8217; said editor Tolly Mags.</p>
<p>The beautiful cover image for the first issue can be found below and is by <a href="https://artgerm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stanley Lau</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/horizon_dawn_comic-_publicity_-_embed-_2020.jpg" /></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time a big Sony property has been given the comic book treatment. In a bizarre game of licensing ping-pong, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man </em>for PS4 was treated to a <a href="https://uk.ign.com/articles/2018/12/17/spider-man-ps4-gets-his-own-marvel-comic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">limited-run comic series</a> which explored Peter Parker&#8217;s relationship with Black Cat within Earth-1048. Granted, that was a more natural fit for the medium, having originated from comics, but who&#8217;s to say that should lessen the reach of Aloy&#8217;s adventures?</p>
<p>This brand new series is set to launch on July 22, 2020. A prequel issue is scheduled to coincide with the so-far unannounced Free Comic Book Day event later in the year.</p>

<p><a href="https://chp.tbe.taleo.net/chp04/ats/careers/v2/viewRequisition?org=GAMES2K&amp;cws=61&amp;rid=3574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the job listing on the Hanger 13 official website</a>, the developer is looking for an executive producer “to lead the development of a key new IP franchise at Hanger 13.” Later on in the description of the job, it’s been mentioned that having experience in building AAA open-world or sandbox games will be an advantage.</p>
<p>After releasing <em>Mafia 3</em> and its post-launch expansions, Hanger 13 has been tight-lipped about its next project for a while, but according to Take-Two Interactive, official details on the studio’s next game will be dropped in the coming months. If Hanger 13 is to work on a new IP, we should wait and see what would happen to the <em>Mafia</em> franchise.</p>
<p>Despite having a brilliant story, <em>Mafia 3</em> was blamed mostly for its tedious level design, somehow outdated graphics, and lots of technical issues. That said, the story and the new protagonist have the potential for a sequel with much-improved gameplay and more polished visuals. However, working on a new IP doesn’t necessarily deny the rumors on <em>Mafia 4</em> and <em>Mafia 2</em> <em>Remastered</em> from happening.</p>

<p>Hanger 13 is a subsidiary of 2K Games with four branches in Brighton, Prague, Novato, and Brno. Led by former LucasArts creative director Haden Blackman, the studio was originally founded in 2013. In collaboration with 2K Czech, Hanger 13 delivered its first title in 2016, which was <em>Mafia 3</em>. At first, the game was aimed to launch on 7th-gen platforms, but then it’s been shifted to current-gen consoles and PC. If you haven&#8217;t played it yet, the Deluxe Edition of the game with all expansions is available for $14.99 on PS4 for a limited time.</p>

However, the studio managed to bring some new creative ideas to the series with last year’s <em>Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts</em>, and the result was surely better than what they had done with the first trilogy of <em>Sniper GW</em>. Hopefully, the new path of the franchise will be continued with <em>Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2</em>.</p>
<p>Officially revealed by CI Games’ president Marek Tyminski <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20200324/prezes-ci-games-marek-tyminski-informuje-o-postepach-prac-przy-kluczowych" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during an interview with a Polish website</a>, the development process for <em>Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2</em> has already started. According to Tyminski, an experienced team is working on the game similar to the previous one, with a lower budget though. The release date of the game is yet to be revealed, but Tyminski ensured fans that it won’t be coming this year. Moreover, the studio president referred to PC and consoles as the target platforms of the game, without mentioning whether it would be a current-gen or next-gen project.</p>
<p>Aside from <em>Sniper GW Contracts 2</em>, Tyminski also updated fans on the development process of <em><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-loses-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lords of the Fallen 2</a></em>, revealing that it’s being developed for next-gen consoles and PC with a modernized vision. Having said that, CI Games is a small team after layoffs occurred in 2018, but they are recruiting new developers right now in order to speed up the pace of the game&#8217;s development.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/sniper-ghost-warrior-contracts-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts</em> launched</a> in November 2019 and received mostly mediocre reviews, but was received better than the first trilogy. With <em>Contracts</em>, CI Games made us forget about the unpolisheded titles of the series while bringing more realistic gameplay, allowing you to finish the objectives in the way you want. If the developer manages to add more exciting missions with various creative objectives to be done, <em>Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2</em> could hopefully be the best entry of the series.</p>

<p>As part of a <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/nier-10th-anniversary-stream-march-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10-hour long 10th anniversary livestream</a> on Sunday, <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreplicantv1p2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>NieR Repilcant ver.1.22474487139</em>&#8230;</a> was announced for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam. And yes, that is the actual title.</p>
<p>The game was revealed through a teaser trailer that consisted of concept art and text. No release date was given, but the announcement did offer a fair amount of details to sift through.</p>
<p>For starters, the series&#8217; big 3 in director Yoko Taro, composer Keiichi Okabe, and Square Enix producer Yosuke Saito are back at the helm, with <a href="https://www.toylogic.com/works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toylogic</a> handling development &#8212; a studio that previously assisted in the development of <em>Dragon Quest XI&#8217;s </em>Nintendo 3DS version, <em>The Evil Within</em>, <em>Kid Icarus: Uprising</em>, and <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em>.</p>
<p>Saito (<a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202003/29195616.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via Famitsu</a>) said the game isn&#8217;t being considered a remake or remaster, but a &#8220;version upgrade.&#8221;</p>
<p>PlatinumGames&#8217; Takahisa Taura, the senior game designer for <em>NieR: Automata</em>, is also involved in some capacity, according to Japanese gaming site <a href="https://gamestalk.net/post-141918/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game&#8217;s Talk</a>. How much he has influenced this new edition of <em>Replicant</em>, though (i.e. will its gameplay be altered to better match <em>Automata&#8217;s</em>), is unclear.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sdn1B0N4k0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Additional info revealed during the livestream (again via <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202003/29195616.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Famitsu</a> and <a href="https://gamestalk.net/post-141918/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game&#8217;s Talk</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Okabe re-recorded the game&#8217;s soundtrack, which will include new songs</li>
<li>New elements have been added to freshen the game up for returning players.</li>
<li>There is a new character.</li>
<li>The game&#8217;s dialogue (in Japan at least) will be fully voiced.</li>
<li>The subject of a new ending came up, Saito&#8217;s response to that was &#8220;<a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202003/29195616.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I don&#8217;t even know.</a>&#8220;</li>
<li>The Japanese voices of 2B (Yui Ishikawa) and 9S (Natsuki Hanae) will have a small role in the game. Ishikawa has already recorded her lines.</li>

<p><em>NieR</em> originally launched in Japan as two separate titles back in April 2010. <em>Replicant</em> was released on the PlayStation 3, while the Xbox 360 received a version dubbed <em>Gestalt, </em>which became the only form of the game the West would receive on either platform.</p>
<p>Both games followed the same story outline, but on different timelines and with different versions of its protagonist, Nier.</p>
<p><em>Replicant</em> stars a young version of the character who is in search of a cure for his ill sister, Yonah. <em>Gestalt </em>follows a much older Nier who is on the same mission, except the relationship has changed from brother and sister to father and daughter.</p>
<p>Design-wise, the games had their shortcomings, and failed to become a major hit. But Taro&#8217;s writing, characters, and world-building, paired with Okabe&#8217;s music, were more than enough for <em>NieR</em> to gain a devout cult following.</p>
<p><em>Nier: Automata</em>, with action game specialists PlatinumGames leading development, came along at the beginning of 2017 and paired that all with stellar gameplay, helping the series finally breakthrough with a bigger audience.</p>
<p><em>Automata&#8217;s</em> done so well, in fact, that it has sold through more than 4.5 million copies since its launch, a milestone that was celebrated during Sunday&#8217;s livestream.</p>

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.dualshockers.com/quarantined-video-games-backlog/"><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Quarantine-Games-1024x576.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" srcset="https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Quarantine-Games-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Quarantine-Games-670x377.jpg 670w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Quarantine-Games-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Quarantine-Games.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p>Since many folks around the world have now quarantined themselves in their homes to help prevent the spread of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19</a>, this is arguably the best time in modern history to do nothing else but play video games. For many, this newfound free time may allow them to pick up some games from yesteryear that they&#8217;ve always been meaning to try out. Others may find it <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/dualshockers-comfort-relaxing-stress-relief-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comforting to return to one of their personal favorite games</a> that they haven&#8217;t played in quite some time. And some will likely dive into multiplayer experiences so that they can still socialize with friends from the cover of their own home. But for me personally, I keep having these strange desires to play the most nonsensical games from my backlog, and I have no earthly idea why.</p>
<p>As this whole coronavirus has really started to take hold in the United States, I&#8217;ve begun realizing that I&#8217;m going to have much more time on my hands in the coming weeks and months. So much so, in fact, that I&#8217;ve actually started to take inventory of my backlog for the first time in awhile. In case you don&#8217;t know how I operate, I have a list on the notes section of my phone that&#8217;s full of &#8220;Games I Want to Play&#8221; at some point in my life. Over the past year or so, I&#8217;ve been so busy playing nothing but new releases (and <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/league-of-legends-review-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>League of Legends</em></a>) that I&#8217;ve opted to kind of stop worrying about this artificial list of games hanging over my head. But as this whole pandemic has come about, I decided to revisit this list and see what I could now finally pick up that I couldn&#8217;t in the past.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-639206 size-large" src="https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Days-Gone-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Days-Gone-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Days-Gone-2-670x377.jpg 670w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Days-Gone-2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Amongst a list of titles that includes critically-acclaimed gems like <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/review-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-im-so-happy-to-be-a-gamer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></a>, all-time classics like <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, and games like <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/red-dead-redemption-2-review-ps4-xb1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a> that I never saw through to the end, the titles that have been jumping out to me the most are the ones that are likely the most mediocre of all. Like, I&#8217;m talking about some truly bizarre games like <em>Resident Evil 6</em>, <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, <em>Days Gone</em>, and <em>Knack 2</em>. So just why are these oddballs the ones that I&#8217;m wanting to play the most? Honestly, I do not know.</p>
<p>I think that of the specific games I&#8217;ve listed here, <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/days-gone-review-ps4/"><em>Days Gone</em></a> is the one that I&#8217;m most able to rationalize why I want to play. Even though I never had a lot of interest in the game leading up to its release last year, I ended up picking it up for reasons I&#8217;m not really sure of not too long after it launched. Since then, it has been sitting on my PS4&#8217;s dashboard and I often see it out of the corner of my eye when I go to play other games. <em>Days Gone</em> had a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/days-gone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pretty mixed reaction from critics</a>, but I&#8217;m actually inclined to believe I may enjoy it a fair amount. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of Ubisoft&#8217;s checklist-style open-world games and <em>Days Gone</em> absolutely seems to have aspects of that. Games of this ilk have often been comfort food for me over the years, so I at least understand why I&#8217;d want to give it a shot.</p>
<p>Sticking with the PlayStation exclusives, <em>Knack 2</em> is the one that I&#8217;m truly a masochist for even giving a thought to play. Believe it or not, I do actually own <em>Knack 2</em>. I bought it essentially as a gag like two years ago when it went on sale at one point in time, and it&#8217;s been sitting on my shelf of games ever since. I&#8217;ve often told my roommate over the years that we need to actually do a full, non-stop playthrough of <em>Knack 2</em> at some point because, &#8220;Haha, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/knack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the memes</a>, dude!&#8221; He thinks I&#8217;m an idiot.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that I bought the original <em>Knack</em> with my PS4 at launch back in 2013 and I played through the entirety of it. My verdict? That game totally stunk. So, again, why would I ever seriously consider playing the sequel like I am right this very moment? I honestly don&#8217;t have an answer for you.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-566821 size-large" src="https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Knack2-13-1024x576.jpg" alt="Knack II" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Knack2-13-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Knack2-13-670x377.jpg 670w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Knack2-13-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Knack2-13.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/review-resident-evil-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Resident Evil 6</em></a> and <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, on the other hand, I can at least understand my desire to play just because I love each franchise so dearly. <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Mass Effect </em>are likely in my personal top 5 of most beloved franchises, which means I&#8217;m a complete sucker for each of them deep down.</p>
<p>In the case of <em>RE6</em> specifically, it&#8217;s the only mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> game that I have never played. When it initially released back in 2012 and I heard it was a disaster, I decided just to avoid it entirely rather than have it break my heart. Since that time, however, I&#8217;ve been morbidly interested in returning to it, especially since <em>Resident Evil</em> has been back on the come-up the past few years with <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/resident-evil-vii-biohazard-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>RE7</em></a>, <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/resident-evil-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>RE2 </em></a><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/resident-evil-2-review/">remake</a>, and next week&#8217;s release of the <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/resident-evil-3-new-trailer-nemesis-jill-carlos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>RE3 </em></a><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/resident-evil-3-new-trailer-nemesis-jill-carlos/">remake</a>. Now that I know the series is in a good place again, what&#8217;s the harm in going back to see it at what many consider to be its lowest point? I&#8217;ve been putting off playing this one for nearly a decade and I&#8217;m thinking I finally need to rectify it.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, a game that&#8217;s so bad some have even claimed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giantbomb/comments/7nqfwk/they_killed_mass_effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it killed the whole series</a> (despite the fact that <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/mass-effect-early-development-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BioWare is reportedly working on a new entry</a>). I came into 2017 more excited for <em>Andromeda</em> than any other game that was set to launch in that year, and after playing it for a few hours, I quickly realized I didn&#8217;t like it at all. Not only was it buggy, but the story, gameplay, and just overall tone of this new world wasn&#8217;t clicking with me whatsoever. It really, really bummed me out greatly that I didn&#8217;t like it initially, but I always swore I&#8217;d finish it one day.</p>
<p>Even as I look at this one on my backlog and legitimately entertain the thought of finally returning to it, I just don&#8217;t know if I can do it. <em>Andromeda</em> is almost like the inverse of <em>RE6</em> for me at the moment. I think I need to see <em>Mass Effect</em> as a whole redeemed before I might be able to play this one all the way through just to see what it has to offer. For now, it&#8217;s just still too painful to know that EA and BioWare really screwed up things up so badly with this entry. It still makes me sad to even talk about.</p>

<p>So, why am I even writing this piece to begin with? Partially, it&#8217;s just to inform you of how dumb my brain is. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m like this. Please, talk some sense into me if you&#8217;re reading this article. Convince me to play <em>The Witcher 3 </em>in its entirety like I know I should be doing rather than diving into <em>Knack 2</em>, of all things.</p>
<p>The other reason though is to just say that it doesn&#8217;t really matter what you&#8217;re playing right now. As long as you&#8217;re deciding to stay at home and &#8220;<a href="https://time.com/5809038/coronavirus-flatten-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flatten the curve</a>&#8221; as we&#8217;ve been told to do, anything from <em>Superman 64</em> to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/persona-5-royal-review-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Persona 5 Royal</em></a> is more than adequate to spend your time with. Playing video games is, bizarrely enough, almost a form of public service at this point in time. Even though your time can surely be spent experiencing many better games than some of the ones I&#8217;ve listed here, take pride in the fact that it&#8217;s now more socially acceptable than ever before to plop down on your couch and do nothing but veg out and play the vidyas.</p>
<p>As for what&#8217;s on the docket for me this weekend? I think I&#8217;m going to actually dive into a replay of <em>Halo 3: ODST </em>because, sure, why not? It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve got anywhere to go.</p>

So it&#8217;s rare when we see a story about a game company forming that&#8217;s unique, and I promise this one is. The voice actor of <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/assassins-creed-origins-xbox-one-x-review-pc-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed Origins</em></a>&#8216; Bayek, Abubakar Salim, is launching his own studio in the UK, officially dubbed Silver Rain Games.</p>
<p>Salim&#8217;s experience is mostly in voice acting. Besides providing an iconic voice to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/assassins-creed-origins-bayek-protagonist-opinion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayek</a>, Salim, a BAFTA-nominated actor, has voiced characters in <em>World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth </em>and <em>The Bradwell Conspiracy</em>. And even though he is pivoting over to the development side of games, Salim is also continuing his acting career in other roles and mediums. He will be appearing in Ridley Scott&#8217;s <em>Raised by Wolves </em>TV series as Father this year.</p>
<p>Looking towards his future in gaming, Salim will be creating and directing a new title with the new Head of Studio at Silver Rain, Melissa Phillips. Phillips has her own history as a Games Program Manager for BAFTA.</p>
<p>As for what we can expect to see from Silver Rain Games, well, that future&#8217;s a bit murkier. So far, everything at the studio is in the prototype stage, with nothing really demonstrable to show. However, from a press release we can tell that whatever the studio has planned, it will be narratively-driven. This release says that the studio is &#8220;particularly keen to welcome new audiences, creating narratives to empower players.&#8221; While that may just sound like the usual industry jargon, it does give us an idea of what could be coming.</p>

Originally released on PC and Switch last year, it&#8217;s a wonderful game that is quick to play through and easy to pick up. Now, it&#8217;ll be even easier for those wanting a bit more spice in their shoot-em-ups to get just that. According to a <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2020/03/27/action-soaked-bullet-ballet-my-friend-pedro-comes-to-ps4-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog post,</a> <em>My Friend Pedro </em>is launching for PS4 next week.</p>
<p>If this is the first time you&#8217;ve heard of <em>My Friend Pedro</em>, here&#8217;s a quick run-down. You&#8217;re a masked gunman egged on to gun down gang members by an imaginary banana named Pedro. He&#8217;s kind of like a goofier Son of Sam. The game has you run, jump and flip through 2D platforming levels full of interesting and stylish ways to take down your enemies. That&#8217;s the focus of the game &#8211; style, and weirdness. You can shoot an enemy&#8217;s head off then kick that head at another enemy to kill them. Sometimes you&#8217;re presented with a skateboard and naturally hit some rad kickflips while dual-wielding Uzis. Combine that with the powers of slow-motion and split-shooting, and your character turns into an unstoppable blur of bullets and chaos. <em>My Friend Pedro </em>is a lot of things, but it sure isn&#8217;t boring or repetitive.</p>
<p>Along its way to the PS4, <em>My Friend Pedro</em> is also picking up some new features and changes. This port will include the game&#8217;s extra Code Yellow content. This expansion adds the most demanded features from the community plus some extra game modifiers to ensure your time with the game is as wild as possible. For fans of speedrunning there&#8217;s an in-game timer, and for folks that want to just run and gun, you can unlock all the weapons from the start and adjust your character&#8217;s speed. Or if you just want to up the game&#8217;s weird-factor, you can enable Big Head mode.</p>
<p><em>My Friend Pedro </em>isn&#8217;t on the PlayStation Store just yet, so you&#8217;ll have to keep an eye out. That shouldn&#8217;t be too hard though since the game does have its set release date &#8211; Thursday, April 2.</p>

Thankfully, video games have been able to help take us out of dark times before, and with so many countries turning to shelter in place orders and more drastic measures, <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/video-games-coronavirus/">gaming is certainly a welcome distraction and source of escape right now</a>.</p>
<p>In light of these heavy times, the <em>DualShockers</em> staff gathered to share some of our favorite games that we turn to when we need them most. Consider these our &#8220;comfort food games&#8221; &#8211; the games that we like to use as outlets for relaxation, stress relief, and a bit of warmth when they&#8217;re needed.</p>

<p>As odd as it sounds, my relaxation games of choice are usually some flavour of strategy title. <em>Stellaris</em> or <em>Civilization 6</em> might have a lot going on, but once you sink the time, in they become fairly rote.</p>
<p>At that point, I’m just juggling resources and expanding my influence across the map. Amass my technology, build my armies, paint the planet(s) the colour of my empire&#8230;the whole thing becomes fairly cathartic. Throw in a podcast to listen to, and you have my wind down method of choice.</p>
<p>For something a little more short duration than those, I’ll play a round of <em>Frostpunk</em> or <em>Northgard</em>, but the same principle applies regardless.</p>

<h2><strong>Ricky Frech, Senior Staff Writer</strong></h2>
<p>When I think about my video game comfort food, there are a few nostalgia-filled games that come to mind. I could easily make this entry about something like <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <em>Diablo II</em>, <em>NCAA Football 2014</em>, or literally any <em>Yakuza</em> game. However, when I look at my YouTube history since my personal quarantine began, the answer is clear. The number of hours I’ve already spent watching <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em> randomizers is kind of shocking, but it makes sense.</p>
<p><em>A Link to the Past</em> is my favorite game of all-time. Rarely would I call a game perfect, but if any game is, it’s this one. And when the team behind the randomizer put out their first release, an incredible thing was born. I’ve played through the original <em>ALTTP</em> more times than I can count. It’s been in my regular rotation since my parents got me a SNES in 1994. I know that map about as well as I know the back of my hand. So, to get something that completely switches all of that up and surprises you at every turn is an absolute joy. No two runs are exactly the same and your game knowledge is often tested in ways you never expected.</p>
<p>Obviously, I wouldn’t recommend you play the randomizer first. If you haven’t played <em>ALTTP</em>&#8216;s original version, please, do yourself a favor and do so now (and easily accessible through Nintendo Switch Online). Like, right now. But once you’ve played through the game a time or twenty, give the randomizer a try. It will not disappoint.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s not normally a game people play for relaxation, my go-to title whenever I sit down to unwind is <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. I like playing competitive games, so whenever I know that I don’t have much time to play, don’t want to start a new game, or trying not to be super active in what I’m doing, I play <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. To me, <em>Smash</em> is just that type of comfort food gaming where I know I can always go to it and turn my brain off for a little. There are times where I play in a more serious fashion to try and better my skills, but normally, I like to kick back, go through a few rounds on auto-pilot, and call it a day.</p>
<p>All I’m waiting for now is <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/sakurai-announce-sora-super-smash-bros/">for Sakurai to announce Sora in the new Fighters Pass</a>. That&#8217;s all I want Sakurai. Please.</p>

<p>Normally some grinding sessions or mini-games in my favorite RPGs is more than enough to soothe this soul. But desperate times call for even stronger coping mechanisms, and so I turn to two games that exclude relaxation.</p>
<p>The first is <em>Flower</em>, which is a title developed by and released by Thatgamecompany in 2009 for the PS3. The player controls the wind as it blows a flower petal through the air. As you fly close to other flowers, you bloom them and attract more petals. There&#8217;s no enemies, no time limits, and the sounds and music are borderline ASMR in how peaceful and tranquil they are. <em>Flower</em>, with its stunning and colorful visuals that convey a subtle message of environmental conservation, is the perfect game to wind down to when the world is too much to handle (especially right now).</p>
<p>The second title is a game that I&#8217;ve raved about before: <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/va-11-hall-a-review-vallhalla-vita/"><em>VA-11 HALL-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action</em></a>. The aesthetic here is much different, as it takes place in a dark and grim cyberpunk future. But instead of focusing on an epic tale on class warfare, you play as an ordinary bartender that serves her eclectic customers as they pour their hearts out. The graphics are straight from a PC-98 Japanese visual novel, and it features an incredible retro soundtrack that you can fully customize. Getting to know each customers&#8217; story while making them drinks in a fun mini-game that lets you endlessly restart bad drink mixing is a great way to wind down, and reminds you to see the everyday humanity in even the worst of situations.</p>

<p>Alright, let’s be frank. The world’s on fire right now &#8211; people are getting sick, international markets are crashing worse than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk6cgp7RcL8"><em>Sonic </em>&#8217;06</a>, and most of us have been told to stay indoors. In short, everything sucks right now, which means it’s a great time for some escapism. While most people are <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-custom-designs/">ditching the real world for their <em>Animal Crossing</em> paradises</a>, me and my friends have opted for something a little more active, and therefore more distracting.</p>
<p>I’m talking about <em>Stardew Valley</em>, Concerned Ape’s farming simulator. Sure it’s not the most relaxing game, but it’s one that you can get into the rhythm of and suddenly hours have passed. See, in <em>Animal Crossing</em>, there’s hardly ever any direction: you just have your chores for the day and then you can go fishing or catch bugs &#8211; it’s pretty loose in structure like that. But in <em>Stardew Valley</em> you’ve got to take care of your plants and your animals, then you have to go to the mine to get iron for sprinklers, and it goes on. It’s much more active and absorbing, not to mention that with friends, you get a wonderful social experience that a bunch of us may be missing right now.</p>
<p>Is <em>Stardew Valley</em> really comfort gaming? Kind of. It’s not high-stress, and it doesn’t raise my BPM like <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/doom-eternal-review/"><em>DOOM Eternal</em></a> does. But it takes me away from it all and gives me something else to focus on without stress or worry. I think that’s something all of us could use a bit of right now.</p>

<p>While gaming in general tends to be one of my favorite sources of relaxation when I get home, there are only a few types of games that I generally turn to time and again for stress relief or comfort. Generally, the two that I tend to come back to the most for good ol&#8217; comfort food gaming are <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> or <em>Destiny 2</em>. They&#8217;re super easy for me to jump into for either short play sessions or longer periods of time, and I can pretty much always find time to play them with friends to hangout and chat with them in Discord.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m looking for something more single-player focused or when I&#8217;m not in a competitive mood, my comfort go-to games are either open-world games or RPGs. It&#8217;s always soothing to me to get lost in a gigantic world or to grind and level up my characters in the JRPG that I&#8217;m playing at the moment on my Switch while listening to some music or a podcast. Open-world games especially tend to just click with a certain part of my brain that loves activities and checklists, which is part of the reason why I put over 90 hours into <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed Origins</em>.</p>
<p>In the current pandemic environment, right now I&#8217;ve been delving into <em>Tokyo Mirage Sessions</em> on Switch among other games, though I think I&#8217;m finally going to take the opportunity to jump into <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed Odyssey</em> and <em>Persona 5</em> soon enough.</p>

<h2><strong>Laddie Simco, Associate Staff Writer</strong></h2>
<p>Like many others, I’ve recently found myself temporarily out of work and quarantined due to the coronavirus. In this troubling time, I’ve sought comfort through video games. Through online games like<em> Destiny 2</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, I’m able to mingle with friends and still practice social distancing. <em>Animal Crossing</em>, the game everyone seems to be playing right now, has provided me with an opportunity to leave my state of isolation and visit a bright island that allows me to virtually go about life without the fear of a virus.</p>
<p>With all of this extra time, I’ve also been revisiting various games and one that has been very soothing these days is <em>Concrete Genie</em>. It ended up <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/dualshockers-favorite-games-of-2019-laddie-simco-top-10/">being one of my favorite games of 2019</a> and I’ve been meaning to wrap up the few remaining trophies I need to turn the concrete into a Platinum. This mostly entails finding certain collectibles that I missed.</p>
<p>Traversing Denska without a care in the world (now that I have completed the story) is often a zen-like experience. I can stop and fill an empty wall with my fantastic murals that seemingly come to life. The adorable Genies are there to lend a hand or play hide and seek or even basketball with. There’s also the VR mode that offers a free paint mode where you can add your personal touch to some of the memorable places from the game’s campaign and then feel as if you have stepped inside of your painting.</p>
<p>For me, <em>Concrete Genie</em> has been the perfect calming game to counter the craziness that is our life right now, as well as the stress of missing a jump in <em>DOOM Eternal</em>.</p>

<h2><strong>Josh Starr, Associate Staff Writer</strong></h2>
<p>I certainly wouldn’t describe these two games as relaxing, but they are my gaming comfort food. These games are second nature to me and provide exciting moments, while being the perfect time to chat with my friends.</p>
<p>The first of these is <em>Smite</em>. I’ve been playing <em>Smite</em> since its first season, and even had a brief stint in the professional scene. I’ve tried every MOBA available, but this is the one for me. Its behind-the-back, third-person camera angle is one way it drastically differentiates itself from other MOBAs, while its mythological theme gives it a more widespread appeal. Its heavy emphasis on skillshots also makes it one of the most difficult games to master in the genre.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <em>Smite</em> can be as casual or competitive as you like. There is the hardcore Conquest mode which can take tons of practice to master, while other modes like Arena are easy to approach and enjoy. It’s an awesome game to play with friends, and there will undoubtedly be playable characters you recognize. Now is a great time to give <em>Smite</em> a shot, as it’s free to play on PC, Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and has crossplay enabled between platforms.</p>
<p>My second comfort game is <em>Borderlands</em>; right now, that means <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/borderlands-3-review/"><em>Borderlands 3</em></a>. Now <em>Borderlands 3</em> received some criticism for its lackluster writing, which is completely warranted. However, <em>Borderlands</em> has never truly been about the story for me. It’s a wonderful zany looter-shooter that gives you the option to completely ignore the story while you run around with buddies searching for the next mind-shattering weapon.</p>
<p>Honestly, aside from the story, <em>Borderlands 3</em> is the series&#8217; best game in every possible way. Combat is greatly improved with thousands of new weapon options, improved special abilities, and increased movement options. Even the car combat, which was abysmal in previous titles, has been greatly improved here. <em>Borderlands 3</em> promotes replayability as each subsequent playthrough increases your likelihood of finding ultra-rare weapons.</p>
<p><em>Borderlands 3</em> just released on Steam, and with another DLC pack being released this week, it’s the perfect time to grab some pals and drop onto Pandora’s surface. I’d go as far as saying that <em>Borderlands 3</em> is the best group multiplayer shooter in recent years, even if sometimes you feel like turning down the game volume and blasting Spotify instead.</p>

<h2><strong>Nick Tricome, Staff Writer</strong></h2>
<p>I love hockey.</p>
<p>I watch it, play it, and depending on the need, even coach it.</p>
<p>I can’t do any of that right now, and probably won’t be able to for quite a while. The current circumstances; they suck. Not having that major outlet to escape them for at least a little bit makes it all feel so much worse.</p>
<p>Video games have had to fill that escapist void now more than they ever have, both for myself and I’m sure millions of others. And while there have been plenty of great new releases to turn to (Hey, <em>Animal Crossing</em>), I’ve found a lot of comfort in spending hours upon hours on <em>NHL 20</em>’s virtual rinks.</p>
<p>Now look, I buy <em>NHL</em> every year and would’ve spent hundreds of hours playing this season’s edition regardless. But the coronavirus pandemic has derailed nearly everything, the NHL season included, turning EA’s annual hockey franchise from a constant in my life to suddenly one of the few constants that remain.</p>
<p>It’s no replacement for the actual sport, it never could be. But in the meantime, taking my Be A Pro into the World of Chel’s pond hockey rinks just to mess around in Ones or drop-in Threes for a bit, or trying to create my best lineup possible through Hockey Ultimate Team, will get the job done. It kind of has to right now.</p>
<p>Please come back soon, Flyers <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>For me, there is a special kind of comfort I find in the grind of RPGs. It’s calming and relaxing to me when I can just set about fighting monster after monster, working towards a goal like learning a special skill or trying to get a rare drop. The repetitive nature of grinding in an RPG lets me go on autopilot, freeing up my mind to take a load off, work through a problem, or just disconnect if I so choose.</p>
<p>The RPG grind is nice because even though you are tuned out and relaxed, there is still a benefit to what you are doing. Your characters are still getting stronger, you’re still getting money, learning skills, etc. A lot of games that will help automate this process somewhat. <em>Bravely Default</em>, the <em>Tales</em> series and <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> for example will allow you to focus on just running around if you want, leaving most of the grunt work to the computer controlled characters.</p>
<p>Another nice thing about RPGs is that if you get sick of grinding for levels, more often than not there is some sort of mini-game that you can grind thrugh instead. I have spent far too much time with the likes of Triple Triad in <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> or that plushie creation mini-game in <em>Bravely Second</em> than I care to admit. And you know what; that’s ok. I’m thrilled that there are a few big RPGs right around the corner to help me relax this next month or two!</p>

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.dualshockers.com/castlevania-season-4-confirmed-be-on-the-way-by-netflix/"><![CDATA[<img width="680" height="383" src="https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Castlevania-Season-4.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="Castlevania, Netflix, Bootleg Multiverse" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" srcset="https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Castlevania-Season-4.jpg 680w, https://www.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Castlevania-Season-4-670x377.jpg 670w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p>Netflix&#8217;s <em>Castlevania</em> series has proven to be wildly popular. The show recently released its ten-episode third season on March 5 and today <a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1243600966407995392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the company confirmed</a> that a fourth season is on the way.  Given how well-regarded the third season was, this is certainly no surprise. However, for fans wanting to spend more time with their favorite characters, it&#8217;s welcome news. Netflix didn&#8217;t reveal many details just yet, instead choosing to only share a short clip from <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/castlevania-netflix-season-3-release-date/"><em>Season 3</em></a>. Give it a look below.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/ZuPyKxGRDF">pic.twitter.com/ZuPyKxGRDF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; NX (@NXOnNetflix) <a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1243600966407995392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As mentioned above, Netflix has yet to share anything like a release date or even how many episodes season four will include. That&#8217;s not altogether surprising given how <em>Season 3</em> was announced. Originally announced the third season back in <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/castlevania-season-3-greenlit-netflix/">November 2018</a> and we had to wait until March 2020 to see it. Expecting the next season to come out before 2021 seems like a bit of wishful thinking. That said, we can be certain that <em>Season 4</em> will be worth whatever wait we have to endure. The entire series has been must-watch thus far, and there&#8217;s no reason for that to continue.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that we&#8217;re yet to hear anything about the other series showrunner Adi Shankar is working on for his <em><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/new-devil-may-cry-animated-series-will-crossover-netflixs-castlevania/">Bootleg Multiverse</a></em>. We know that Shankar is working on different series based on <em>Devil May Cry</em>, <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em>, and <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>. However, it&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve heard anything too concrete on those projects. Obviously, with <em>Castlevania</em> being as successful as it is, it&#8217;s not a surprise to see it being the focus. That said, the idea of <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> show in a similar style to <em>Castlevania</em> sounds amazing.</p>
<p>For now, we only know that <em>Castlevania Season 4</em> is coming. You can watch the first three on Netflix now.</p>
